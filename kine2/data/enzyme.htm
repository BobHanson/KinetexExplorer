<input type=hidden name=sinfo value="When a catalyst (E) is in small relative concentration as it is here, the rate becomes independent of substrate (A) concentration, because the enzyme becomes 'saturated' and cannot go any faster. ||Note in this case how plotting [A] vs. time is a straight line (0-order in A)! and how d[A]/dt is rock-stable throughout the reaction. ||Change the concentrations of [A] or [E] and observe the effect on the rate.||You may want to start the plotting after 20 seconds if you use a trend line.">
