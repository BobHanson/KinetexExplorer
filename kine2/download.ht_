<h3>Downloading instructions for Bob's JavaScript Kinetics Simulation</h3>
(PC-users only, sorry....)
<p>
You can download <a href=kinetic_VER_.exe>kinetic_VER_.exe</a> (_DATE_),
which allows you to run the calculator, including plotting
(if you are running Netscape 3.0 on a PC), without
being connected to a network.
<p>
After downloading the file into a temporary directory, simply execute the file from within windows (or from a DOS prompt if using Windows'95).
<p>
In addition, if you want to plot locally, you will need to tell Netscape of a new MIME-TYPE. Under 'preferences' 'helpers'
define the following MIME-TYPE:
<pre>
type:   application/x-windata
ext:    WDT  (preferred, but this is not used)
run:    windata DISPLAY %1
</pre>
The local version will load from <a href=file:///c:/jskine/index.htm>file:///c:/jskine/index.htm</a>
<p>
If Windata fails to start because files are missing, please contact me so I can send them to you and include them in an updated graph.zip file.
<p>
Sorry Macintosh fans. I don't write for the Mac.
<p>For some unexplained reason, Netscape Communicator and MS-IE4 refuse to launch Windata locally, at least in my hands.
So if you have to use those browsers, the application/x-windata [x] local mode plotting is out.
You can still use Wdisplay to display the graphs, but they must come from my server by reflection
over the internet, not directly from Javascript. Thus you must have Netscape 3.0 on a PC to use the
calculator without an active internet connection. Strange, but true.
If you can figure out what I am doing wrong, let me know.
For other programs I have written, see my <a href=ftp://ftp.stolaf.edu/pub/origami/WIN>ftp site</a>.
