This is just in the beginning of development.
Note that application/x-windata is only
available on a PC. You must download the windata.exe
application from my web site.

9:08 AM 9/15/98 "Simple Two-Step" fixed. I had the
  filename NO2CO instead of no2co

9:09 AM 9/15/98 Still having memory problems in 
  some browsers. This shows up as a graph request
  that looks blank, but if you select the blank screen
  you will see some of the page hiding there. I don't
  know what to do about this. It appears to be a
  feature of how Netscape reacts to running out of
  memory. (Don't tell the user, just fake it.)

10:11 AM 9/15/98 Netscape 4 and IE 4 both are incapable
  of displaying using the local windata.exe application
  DO NOT CHECK THIS BOX if you have these browsers. It
  will lock up your browser.
