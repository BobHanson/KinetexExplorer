Q_ask("This reaction is associated with the overall equation 2A + B --> C. From the graph, how can you tell that the coefficient of A in the chemical equation is not the same as the coefficient of B?"
,"The concentrations of A and B both decrease with time, but the concentration of B decreases more slowly than the concentration of A. So their coefficients in the chemical equation for the reaction must not be the same.")
Q_ask("Click on the point on the graph representing the concentration of A after 2 seconds. The triangle shown on the left represents the rate of change in [A] (slope of the curve, in moles/liter/second) at that time. Is it positive or negative? Why?"
,"The rate of change in [A] is negative. That's because A is a reactant. Its concentration is decreasing.")
Q_ask("Click on the point on the graph representing the concentration of B after 2 seconds. What is the relationship between the rate of change in [A] and the rate of change in [B] at this time. What does this tell you about the coefficient of B in the chemical equation for this reaction?"
,"The rate of change in [B] is the half the rate of change in [A] throughout the reaction. (Both are negative, but the value for A is twice the value for B.) So the coefficient of B in the chemical equation must be half that for A.")
Q_ask("How can we tell that the reaction is slowing down with time?",
"All the curves initially have steep slopes, but this slope approaches 0 as the reaction proceeds.")
