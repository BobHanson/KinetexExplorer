# KinetexExplorer
The website used for first-year chemistry at St. Olaf College to encourage the exporation of introductory kinetics 

There are two primary source directories:

kinetex/    the core code for the Kinetex Explorer website
[https://www.stolaf.edu/depts/chemistry/courses/toolkits/126/kinetex/concept]

kine2/      the kinetics engine that backs the Kinetex Explorer website
[https://www.stolaf.edu/depts/chemistry/courses/toolkits/126/js/kinetics/]

You are welcome to clone and adapt it. I had a lot of fun putting it together and using it for many years when teaching Chemistry 126 at St. Olaf College. I would enjoy seeing what you can do with it. I am not currently developing it.
