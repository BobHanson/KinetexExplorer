# KinetexExplorer
The website used for first-year chemistry at St. Olaf College to teach introductory kinetics 

You are welcome to clone and adapt it. I had a lot of fun putting it together and using it for many years when teaching Chemistry 126 at St. Olaf College. I would enjoy seeing what you can do with it. I am not currently developing it.

There are two primary source directories:

kinetex/    the core code and website

kine2/      the kinetics engine that backs the website
